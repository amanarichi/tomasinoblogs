                    UST Quadricentennial Square stands as a vibrant focal point at the heart of the University of Santo Tomas, commemorating four centuries of academic excellence with its architectural grandeur, inviting spaces, and a pulsating energy that encapsulates the rich history and dynamic spirit of the institution.                    <br/>

                    </br>
                    It is possible that the square was created to commemorate the 400th anniversary of UST, which is the oldest university in Asia founded by the Dominicans on April 28, 1611.                    <br/>

                    Quadricentennial Square is one of the most important areas on the UST campus. It is likely to be used for hosting events and festivities to commemorate the university's past. The square might also serve as a venue for various occasions and get-togethers, including those attended by students, staff, and outside guests.                    <br/>

                    The Quadricentennial Park/Square in UST is a lively addition to the surroundings of UST. It features several Al Fresco areas, a sophisticated design, and an interactive fountain that opens at 6 p.m. The park's focal point is Ramon Orlina's "tetragonal" sculpture, which stands for the many stakeholders of the institution. The sculpture portrays four figures: a male and female student, a professor, and a Dominican priest.                    <br/>

                    The Benavides Garden, which spans from the Benavides Monument to the Arch of the Centuries, the Plaza Mayor in front of the Main Building, and the Quadricentennial Square between the Main Building and the Benavides Library are all filled with students exhibiting various emotions, ranging from happiness to anxiety. Despite this, they are generally excited about the prospect of a new day, whether in class or off-campus, confident that their hard work and dedication will pay of        </div>
